These are our amendments.  
Live by them, or you shall perish.

## Basics 🧼

🔁 Things to clean every time they are used:

- Sinks
  - Empty filter
  - Clean surfaces
- Stovetops
- Countertops 
- Tables
- Trays  
*Baking paper can be left for the next person if reusable*
- Keep countertops free of things that are not cleaning supplies.  
*Put stuff back before you leave the kitchen.*  
*Do not leave something to soak, unless absolutely necessary.*

🙈 Things to clean if you made a mess:

- Microwave 💥  
Always check if your food was playing with explosives, and clean up if it did.
- Oven 🍕  
If something drips or spills while using the oven, wait for it to cool down and clean up.  
We have a fancy scraper to make your life easier, see supplies-overview.
- Garbage 🏀  
Do not ignore the glaring proof that you are not LeBron James when aiming at the trash bins. Accept this, and clean up the resulting stain. It happens to all of us.
- Toaster 🥪  
Those crumbs might have escaped the toaster, but that doesn't mean they will escape you.  
Also, do not let cheese establish a colony in the toast press. 🧀🏴

## Bugs

🦟🦋🕷🐞🐝🐜🐛

The building is infested by mealworms.  
They love sugar, flour and anything with carbohydrates more than the average American, so protect your precious resources with airtight containers, plastic bags or wrap.
