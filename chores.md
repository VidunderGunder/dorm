# Cleaning Chores 🧼

Chores are done by groups of 2 (or 3 if necessary) on a weekly basis. 👩🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏼📅  
See blackboard for grouping and weeks. 👨‍🏫

If you're not available, make a deal for someone to step in for you. 🤝

Typically, cleaning is done on Wednesday and Sunday.  
Feel free to adjust this, but leave a few days between each time.  
Do not postpone to the following week, unless the next group agrees.
